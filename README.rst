Description
###########

The goal of this project is to identify tweets containing sexism and racism as two
prominent aspects of hate speech. The dataset used is available on `Hugging
Face <https://huggingface.co/datasets/tweets_hate_speech_detection>`__ and includes 31,962 labled tweets.
To do so several classification models were implemented:

*  `Decision Tree <https://github.com/Aaron9812/Data_mining/blob/main/src/models/final_decision_tree.ipynb>`__
*  `Logistic Regression <https://github.com/Aaron9812/Data_mining/blob/main/src/models/regression.ipynb>`__
*  `Naive Bayes <https://github.com/Aaron9812/Data_mining/blob/main/src/models/Naive_Bayes.ipynb>`__
*  `Support Vector Machine <https://github.com/Aaron9812/Data_mining/blob/main/src/models/SVM-final.ipynb>`__
*  `Neural Network <https://github.com/Aaron9812/Data_mining/blob/main/src/models/NN_with_CV.ipynb>`__
*  `K-Nearest Neighbor <https://github.com/Aaron9812/Data_mining/blob/main/src/models/KNN_latest_v2.ipynb>`__
